"You should have gone through your carrier immediately, not when the other company refused to negotiate in good faith. It has been my experience that people who file claims directly with the other person's carrier very often make very incriminating, very foolish remarks, in response to very pointed questions that the carrier asks in order to PROVE that their insured was not at fault. A common question is ""Did you see him/her coming?"" You say no, and suddenly you weren't paying attention when the other company refused to negotiate in good faith. Yes, turn it over to your company. If it is as you say - a hit in the rear - there is no reason for a reputable company to increase your premium.",1,4
"Getting a larger capacity battery is not a problem if it will physically fit in the car. If it will not fit in the place made for it, it is no bargain regardless of the price.",2,4
"The little 2.3 liter, 4-cylinder engine in my Ranger pickup requires 520 CCA or something like that. I put a 1000 CCA battery in 2 years ago, because there is room. I have jump started several people's cars in past winters, with good results! I didn't even have my engine running. I have no electrical problems. So I personally believe that it is ok. I can't imagine a negative reason. ",2,13
"Yes, but if it recommends premimum then it will get less performance if you put regular gasoline it it.",3,11
"If the car *requires* premium fuel then you need to use premium. If the car *recommends* premium fuel then you can use regular, but you'll get less power and less fuel economy.",3,6
"Although the lien would appear to be released, the debt is still owed. The CU are still able to pursue you in court over the debt. Whether they will win probably depends on if they find the missing documentation.",4,17
"No you don't own it. You still have to pay per your loan agreement. Technically it is not a clear title. If you don't continue making payments they'll simply file a lien against it through your state attorney general's office. However, although it would piss them off,, what you probably can do now is sell the vehicle without their signature release on the title - BUT you'll still have to immediately repay the loan in full if you do that. If you don't and the buyer discovers there is a lien against it, they can probably sue you big time.",4,5
"With that amount of milage, it would be a good idea. It wouldn't benefit the vehicle in any way, its not like you'll gain 20 horsepower or gain 10 miles per gallon. It will just be a new part and you'll already be there in the engine, so why not replace it before it does break and leaves you stranded?",5,3
