1,Got hit by a driver with terrible insurance company. They don't want to pay. What should I do?,"Long story short, I got rear ended by someone with American Access insurance. Never head of them either. It was their policy holder's fault. They ask me to send pictures of the damage, which I did. Today they call me and offer me $250 for the damage. I immediately think.. No way. I go and get estimates from three reputable body shops in my area which range from $1500-1800. When I called them back, they tried to offer me $500. Bottom line is they are being extremely difficult, and it doesn't seem that I will get the money I need to fix my brand new car. I checked their google reviews and other people are having the same problems.",5,0
2,Is it okay to use a more powerful battery on a car?,I need a new battery for my car. Was considering an optima red top... I went to advanced auto and the right one for my car has 720 cold cranking amps and 910 cranking amps. Then on ebay i found a brand new one cheap but slightly more powerful 800 cold cranking amps and 1000 cranking amps.. If i got the ebay one would that difference in power do me really wrong?,10,0

4,"If I have the title to my car in my possession with no lien holder stated, is the car technically mine?","18 months ago I moved from one State to another. When I requested a copy of the title for registering in my new State, the Credit Union could not find it. They had to call the previous lien holder (we had refinanced to a lower rate), who also, could not find it. I had to apply for a new title (out of their pocket, NOT mine), and they sent the title (with no lien holder) to us. I don't know what the hell I'm doing so I just filed it away. Until about a week ago, the CU sent us a letter requesting it back, because obviously they have realized they lost it...AGAIN. So now I'm thinking, wait, If I HAVE the clear title, doesn't that mean I own it? Do I have to continue to pay? Technically, I have the truck and the title, possession is 9/10 of the law right? Thoughts?",17,0
5,"When changing out your spark plugs, is it important to replace the coil pack?","I was told it was a good idea to change the distributor cap and rotor...then found out that I have a coil pack. Would it be beneficial to replace it? Just hit 140,000 miles. Thanks!",14,0
