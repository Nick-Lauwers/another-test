          5. Agreements between Users of Our Sites
        </p>
        
        <p class="faq-info">
          Our Sites allow property owners and managers to advertise their 
          properties (each, an "Advertiser") to potential student tenants (each, 
          a "Student").
        </p>
        
        <p class="faq-info">
          You may use the Sites as a guest user or a registered user. Once you 
          have discovered a property that best suits your needs, you can click 
          the “Request to Book” or "Contact an Expert" button when viewing the 
          relevant property and complete the booking request form. The booking 
          request form includes your name, email address, phone number and 
          information concerning the length of stay. No payment details are 
          required at this stage and there is no commitment to rent a room. Our 
          personal booking consultant will then contact you to confirm and 
          discuss the accommodation type that you require.
        </p>
        
        <p class="faq-info">
          We do not own or manage, nor do we contract for, any rental property 
          listed on our Sites. We will not be a party to any agreement between 
          an Advertiser and a Student. All aspects of a transaction between a 
          Student and an Advertiser, including (but not limited to) the quality, 
          condition, safety or legality of the properties advertised and the 
          ability of a user to enter into a transaction are solely the 
          responsibility of each user. We do not represent, or negotiate, or 
          carry out research on the part of or act on behalf of either 
          Advertisers or Students. We do not receive any direct rental fee 
          payment or deposit guarantee from a Student.
        </p>
        
        <p class="faq-info">
          We do not accept any responsibility for the confirmation of a Student 
          and/or Advertiser's identity. We encourage users to take all such 
          steps as necessary to communicate directly with a Student/Advertiser 
          (as applicable) to assure yourself of the other person's identity, 
          details of the property and any tenancy agreement.
